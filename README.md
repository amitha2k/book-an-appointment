# book-an-appointment
This project aims at providing a convenient platform for students I tutor to check when I am available and book appointments with me.

**Motivation**
It takes a few emails back and forth to determine a date and time for a meeting as we discuss our availabilities. This platform will allow students to look at my availabilities for the next week and book a slot. The platform then automatically updates the slot to being unavailable saving me time to make those changes myself. No double bookings, no missed emails or late replies!

**The Idea**
The site must have a calendar layout where one can see time slots for the current week and the next week. The week will be split into days and each day will be broken up into half-hour time slots. The available time slots will be clickable and the rest will not. When one clicks on an available time slot, a form will pop up asking for name, email, course that they wish to be tutored in, mode of tutoring (online or in-person) and further comments as an optional question. Once they fill out the form, a confirmation will pop up mentioning that their appointment has been scheduled. Additionally, if they chose to betutored in-person, the pop-up will also include the location where I tutor. As a further development, I could add an option for them to attach files which might be assignment questions or anything else they would like me to see beforehand.

This information must all be updated to a database accessible by me and the relevant changes regarding my availbility must be made to the site.
